# c64-https — architecture notes

TLS 1.3 / HTTPS client for the Commodore 64, assembled with ca65/ld65 and
delivered as a single PRG. Networking is provided by the ip65/RR-Net stack
(prebuilt blob at $2000). All crypto is hand-written 6502 tuned to fit
under the BASIC ROM shadow at $A000.

This file is the load-bearing "how does this hang together" reference.
Keep it terse.

## Build

Dependencies:
  - `ca65`, `ld65` from cc65 (ACME is no longer required)
  - GNU make
  - VICE (`x64sc`) only for `make run` / the test harness

Targets:
  - `make`              — default, produces `build/c64-https.prg`
                          and `build/labels.txt` (VICE label format)
  - `make clean`        — remove build artifacts
  - `make run`          — autostart the PRG in VICE
  - `make ip65-libs`    — rebuild ip65 object libraries from the submodule
                          (only needed if the ip65 submodule changes)
  - `make ip65-blob`    — rebuild `ip65-build/ip65-c64.bin` from those
                          libraries (the committed blob is normally reused)

Variables:
  - `BACKEND=ip65|uci`  — select networking backend cfg
                          (`cfg/c64-https-$(BACKEND).cfg`; default ip65)
  - `CA65`, `LD65`      — toolchain overrides
  - `VICE`              — override the `make run` emulator

Test harness expectations:
  - Most `tools/test_*.py` scripts run `make clean && make` themselves
    before launching VICE. Set `C64_SKIP_BUILD=1` in the environment to
    reuse the already-built PRG (7 scripts currently honor the var —
    see the "Honor C64_SKIP_BUILD" commit for the list).
  - Use the `c64-test-harness` Python package to launch VICE; never run
    `x64sc` directly from tests.

## Crypto ABI

Public crypto API is fronted by `src/crypto_abi.inc`. TLS/HTTP sources
consume crypto only through the symbols listed there. The intent is
that any implementation (in-tree today, vendored sibling library
tomorrow) can fulfil the contract by providing the same `.export`s;
swapping implementations is a link-line change, not a call-site change.

Public symbols (calling conventions are AX=pointer-low/high-byte except
where noted, buffers provided by caller, keys/IVs passed via fixed
buffers in the crypto BSS — see per-module headers for details):

  X25519 / field arithmetic  (c64-x25519 sibling)
    x25519_scalarmult     — X25519 scalar × point, 32-byte buffers
    fe25519_mul, fe25519_sqr, fe25519_inv

  ChaCha20-Poly1305         (c64-ChaCha20-Poly1305 sibling)
    chacha20_encrypt
    poly1305_init, poly1305_update, poly1305_final
    aead_encrypt, aead_decrypt

  SHA-256                   (in-tree; no sibling)
    sha256_init, sha256_update, sha256_final

  ECDSA P-256 point ops     (c64-nist-curves sibling)
    ec_point_double, ec_point_add, ec_jacobian_to_affine

P-384 is *stubbed* (see `project_p384_stubbed` memory note). The
`ecdsa_*_384.asm` files exist but are not assembled in the ca65 build
— they must be restored before real cert chains that require P-384.

MEMORY requirements for a drop-in sibling library:
  - Code + rodata must load into the `CRYPTO` region at **$6000-$9FFF**
    (below the BASIC ROM shadow at $A000, so it survives ROM banking).
  - `TABLES_BSS` (`x25519` squaring tables etc.) must stay **below $A000**;
    the cfg pins it inside the CRYPTO region with `align = $100`.
  - Zero-page usage is defined in `src/constants.inc` — fe25519 lives at
    `$2C-$37`, x25519 state at `$38-$3A`, ECDSA bignum at `$22-$3C`.
    These ranges are time-shared (fe25519 and ChaCha20 never overlap).
  - REU Profile B is the baseline. `project_x25519_optimization` notes
    that VICE needs `-reu -reusize 512` for the optimized X25519 tables.

## Networking backend ABI

Public net API is fronted by `src/net_abi.inc`. TLS/HTTP sources consume
networking only through those symbols. Switching backend = picking a
different `cfg/c64-https-$(BACKEND).cfg` and linking different
`src/net/<backend>/*.o` files.

Current backends:
  - `src/net/ip65/` — ip65/RR-Net (cs8900a driver). The ip65 blob is
    prebuilt to `ip65-build/ip65-c64.bin` and loaded at $2000 via
    `src/net/ip65/ip65_blob.s` (`.incbin`). `src/net/ip65/net.s`
    is the ABI adapter. `src/net/ip65/ip65_symbols.inc` is the single
    source of truth for the `ip65_*` jump-table / variable-table
    equates (Phase 7 consolidated these out of `constants.inc`).
  - `src/net/uci/`  — Ultimate 64 Elite (U64E) UCI backend. See the
    "UCI backend" section below for details. `make BACKEND=uci`
    produces a working PRG; `cfg/c64-https-uci.cfg` defines the
    UCI-specific memory map.

Public symbols (see `src/net_abi.inc`):
  net_init, net_poll, net_dhcp_acquire
  net_tcp_connect, net_tcp_send, net_tcp_close, net_tcp_set_recv_cb
  net_dns_resolve
  net_local_ip, net_resolved_ip, net_last_error, net_tcp_state

## UCI backend

`make BACKEND=uci` builds the UCI variant. Default is still `BACKEND=ip65`;
both backends coexist and share the same TLS/HTTP/crypto code.

### UCI register map

UCI I/O registers live at **$DF1B-$DF1F**; firmware identification byte
is **$C9**. See `src/net/uci/uci_regs.inc` for the full equate list
(CMD_PUSH, CMD_CTRL, STAT, DATA, ID).

### UCI command primitives

`src/net/uci/uci_cmd.s` provides shared subroutines used by `net.s`:
`uci_wait_idle`, `uci_begin_cmd`, `uci_push_wait`, `uci_end_cmd`,
`uci_read_data`, etc. No zero-page usage — all absolute addressing
and self-modifying code.

### DNS

UCI firmware resolves hostnames internally during `TCP_CONNECT`. There
is no DNS code in the adapter. `net_dns_resolve` memcpies the hostname
into `uci_host_buf` (256 bytes in UCI_BSS); `net_tcp_connect` passes
it to firmware. Dotted-quad IP literals work because firmware passes
them through.

### Firmware quirk — FPGA register timing (delay-loop fence)

The U64E's UCI FPGA needs **~38 us** between consecutive register
accesses regardless of CPU clock speed. At stock 1 MHz the bus cycle
time naturally satisfies this. At turbo speeds (4-48 MHz) the CPU
outruns the FPGA, causing double-latched writes and stale reads that
corrupt the UCI command protocol.

**Fix:** A nested delay-loop macro `uci_fence` (defined in
`src/net/uci/uci_regs.inc`) is inserted after every read/write to UCI
registers `$DF1C-$DF1F`. Parameters: `UCI_FENCE_OUTER = 5`,
`UCI_FENCE_INNER = 100`, yielding ~2525 cycles (~52 us at 48 MHz,
35% safety margin). 14 bytes per fence site, 24 fence sites total
(11 write + 13 read). At 1 MHz the same loop costs ~2.5 ms per
access — negligible for networking.

48 MHz turbo is fully supported and verified on real U64E hardware.

### Memory layout under UCI

The NET_CODE/NET_BSS regions ($2000-$5FFF) are repurposed:

  $2000-$3FFF  UCI_CODE     UCI adapter code (`net.s`, `uci_cmd.s`)
  $4000-$5FFF  UCI_BSS      `uci_host_buf`, ipaddr scratch, socket
                            state, command control block

All other regions (LOADER, CRYPTO, SHADOW_BSS, TCP_BUF) are identical
to the ip65 layout.

### UCI test scripts

Scripts under `tools/uci/` require a U64E (default 192.168.1.81,
overridable via the `U64_HOST` environment variable) and use
`DeviceLock` + `enable_uci`/`disable_uci`:

  - `boot_check.py`       — verify UCI firmware detection and boot banner
  - `phase2_check.py`     — DHCP acquire + local IP readback
  - `phase3_tcp_echo.py`  — TCP connect/send/recv against a local echo server
  - `test_http_local.py`  — HTTP GET against a local test server
  - `test_http_live.py`   — HTTP GET against a real internet host (requires
                            internet access from the U64E)
  - `test_https_local.py` — HTTPS e2e scaffolding against a local TLS 1.3
                            listener (ECDSA-P256 cert from
                            `tools/https_e2e/certs/`). DMAs a 6502 stub
                            that calls `http_get`, flips the U64E to the
                            CPU speed selected by `TURBO_MHZ` (default
                            48; `TURBO_MHZ=1` runs at stock 1 MHz with
                            all wall-clock budgets auto-scaled by 48x
                            and has been validated end-to-end on real
                            U64E hardware), and captures full
                            diagnostics on pass or timeout.
                            `DEBUG_CAPTURE=1` enables a bounded 6510
                            bus stream for post-mortem.
                            Each run writes a timestamped artifact dir
                            under `$UCI_DEBUG_DIR` (default
                            `/tmp/uci_https_debug/<ISO>/`) containing:
                            packed raw trace (`trace.bin` + meta sidecar),
                            derived `summary.txt` / `tail.txt` /
                            `uci_accesses.txt`, the full 4 KB ring
                            (`ring.bin` + `ring_meta.json`), a DMA-read
                            TLS state snapshot (`tls_state_dump.json`),
                            the listener's `server_result.json`, and
                            `run_info.txt`. Rotation keeps the last 5
                            dirs; `UCI_DEBUG_KEEP_ON_PASS=1` preserves
                            PASS runs. The TLS state snapshot now
                            includes the full 548 B `tls_rec_buf`
                            (handshake plaintext is parsed in place
                            there — see Known issues below for the
                            current stall site).

### End-to-end HTTPS status

The TLS 1.3 handshake now completes end-to-end against the local test
listener (ECDSA-P256 cert, `tools/https_e2e/certs/`) on **both** backends:
UCI/U64E at 48 MHz turbo and stock 1 MHz, and ip65/VICE at stock 1 MHz
no-WARP (after the 255-byte TCP RX clamp fix in `src/net/ip65/net.s`;
see `tests/test_phase3_https_1mhz.py`). The flow, identical across both
backends:

  - ClientHello → ServerHello (X25519 key share)
  - EncryptedExtensions, Certificate, CertificateVerify (ECDSA-P256
    verify against server.pem takes ~85 s wall-clock; see the ECDSA
    benchmark subsection)
  - Server Finished verified
  - Client Finished computed + sent under HS write key
  - Application traffic keys derived; AEAD seq counters reset to 0
  - HTTP/1.1 GET sent under app write key
  - Server NewSessionTicket records (rejected as non-application),
    then the HTTP response record — decrypted, fed into the TCP
    ring, parsed by `http_recv_response`
  - `http_status = 200`, `http_resp_buf = "HELLO FROM TLS SERVER"`,
    `http_resp_len = 21`

### Summary of recent fixes (post-PR23 branch)

Five latent bugs and three new ones were cleared to get here:

  1. `tls_transcript_update` 16-bit length fix
     (pre-existing, cherry-picked `2f01c0d`).
  2. CertVerify / Finished transcript ordering — snapshot before
     dispatch, fold after (`2bb014a`).
  3. `fp_zero` clobbering Y across calls in `ecdsa_parse_der_sig`
     (`f006f10`).
  4. Off-by-one SHA-256 length field in CertificateVerify signed
     digest (`4a2c4f3`).
  5. `tls_derive_traffic_keys` not setting CLC on success
     (`cf8d326`).
  6. Client Finished ordering vs. traffic-key derivation, and
     reloading `hkdf_prk` from `tls_c_hs_secret` before computing
     the client Finished HMAC (`4130356`).
  7. AEAD sequence counters reset at handshake→application key
     boundary per RFC 8446 §5.3 (`a18f324`).
  8. `http.s` state_body now polls when ring briefly empty instead
     of declaring the body complete on the first empty tick
     (`7821ffb`) — removed the "http_status parses, body truncated"
     symptom documented previously as a known issue.
  9. `http_recv_response` state transitions fall through instead of
     returning @not_done, so one dispatch walks status + headers +
     body when they all fit in a single TLS record (`fbc7d10`).
 10. ip65 TCP RX callback 255-byte clamp removed (PR #27). The old
     callback truncated `cb_remaining` to 255 when the high byte was
     non-zero while ip65 ACKed the full `tcp_inbound_data_length`,
     silently dropping bytes 256+. Any TLS record &gt;255 B (Certificate
     in particular, ~369 B in the local listener setup) got partially
     delivered and the TLS reassembly buffer ended up gluing a prefix
     of record N onto bytes from record N+1. Replaced with a
     16-bit-safe copy loop that mirrors the UCI adapter.

### Known issues

  - `http_recv_response` now terminates body-read on a Content-Length
    match: a 16-bit `http_content_length` sentinel ($FFFF = absent)
    lives in SHADOW_BSS at `$A851`, populated by a case-insensitive
    header match for `Content-Length:` requiring a single SP after
    the colon. Once `http_resp_len` equals `http_content_length`,
    state_body returns C=0 and `http_get` exits cleanly. When the
    header is absent the parser falls back to the previous
    keep-polling behaviour (preserves chunked/streaming paths).
  - `net_tcp_set_recv_cb` is an RTS stub (no callers in-tree).
  - Boot banner line 03 still says "rr-net" under ip65 build even
    though Phase 2 made it backend-aware — this is correct/expected
    behavior. Under UCI it says "ULTIMATE 64 ELITE (UCI)".
  - The delay-loop fence adds ~2.5 ms overhead per UCI register access
    at 1 MHz (negligible for networking, but visible in tight loops).
  - `http_resp_buf` is rendered as raw ASCII on the C64 screen instead
    of being translated to screen codes, so the response body displays
    as graphics characters. Response bytes themselves are correct —
    purely cosmetic. Tracked as issue #28.

### ECDSA P-256 verify wall-clock

`ecdsa_verify` of the RFC 6979 test vector on a U64E at 48 MHz turbo
runs in ~85 s median (see `tools/uci/bench_ecdsa_u64e.py` for the
protocol).  The full `tls_connect` handshake — which does one
ECDSA verify over the CertificateVerify signature — takes ~110 s
wall-clock end-to-end.  The remainder is network I/O + SHA-256 +
X25519 + Finished HMACs + handshake state-machine overhead.

~85 s does not fit a typical 10-30 s real-world server handshake
window, so the current implementation is a blocker for arbitrary
internet TLS targets that require ECDSA-P256 CertificateVerify.
It is fine for the local listener used by the e2e harness (600 s
budget, ample headroom). The speedup path is a sibling-style
optimized P-256 implementation (parallel to the `c64-x25519`
effort) that can be dropped in through the Crypto ABI without
touching TLS call sites.

### Design note — bounded timeouts must use wall-clock time

Any future robustness work on the UCI adapter's spin-wait helpers
(`uci_wait_idle`, `uci_push_wait`, etc.) MUST use a wall-clock time
source — CIA timer on stock C64, TOD clock on U64E — rather than a
cycle-counted iteration budget. The fences around every UCI register
access make per-iteration cost scale with CPU speed: a budget that is
ample at 1 MHz collapses to far too short at 48 MHz because turbo
scales CPU cycles but not the FPGA's wire-level operation durations.
A prior attempt on branch `feat/net-drain-abi` split waits into
fast/long tiers with cycle-count budgets and broke DHCP at turbo for
exactly this reason; the branch was abandoned.

## Memory layout

Defined in `cfg/c64-https-ip65.cfg`. Physically contiguous file-backed
regions run from $0801 through $9FFF, with SHADOW_BSS at $A000 and the
TCP ring at $C000.

  $0801-$1FFF  LOADER       BASIC stub + boot + TLS + HTTP + net wrapper
  $2000-$3FFF  NET_CODE     ip65 code (as .incbin blob) / UCI adapter,
                            plus LOADER_OVERFLOW tail
  $4000-$5FFF  NET_BSS      ip65 BSS (zero-filled in the PRG)
  $6000-$9FFF  CRYPTO       all crypto code, rodata, and TABLES_BSS
  $A000-$BFFF  SHADOW_BSS   mutable state behind BASIC ROM shadow
                            (CPU port $01 = $36 selects RAM)
  $C000-$CFFF  TCP_BUF      `tcp_recv_buf`, 4KB ring for ip65 callback

`LOADER_OVERFLOW` is a small segment carrying ~125 B of `http.s` growth
(Content-Length parser + digit pattern) that did not fit in LOADER's
~50 B of slack. It rides in the tail of `NET_CODE`, after the ip65
blob under the ip65 backend and after the UCI adapter under the UCI
backend. Both `cfg/c64-https-ip65.cfg` and `cfg/c64-https-uci.cfg`
declare it. Reachable via JSR from LOADER-resident CODE.

Tight regions (after Phase 6 fit-up):
  - **CRYPTO** is **100%** full. Any new crypto byte requires relocation
    or reclamation somewhere.
  - **SHADOW_BSS** was **99.8%** full after Phase 6; ≈258 B was reclaimed
    in the `tls_hs_buf` removal (256 B buffer + 2 B length word), so
    there is a bit more slack now. Still the tightest region after
    CRYPTO — check the linker map before adding anything sizeable.

There is a known TODO to restructure the MEMORY map so that all
file-backed regions are physically contiguous in a single ROM-like
run (the LOADER/NET gap is currently zero-filled into the PRG just
to keep offsets right). That cleanup is explicitly **out of scope**
for the ca65-conversion branch — see the Phase 6 commit for the
rationale and follow-up plan.

### LOADADDR / exports stubs

Two small `src/*.s` files exist as thin wrappers to work around
ld65 and ca65 edge cases; they are intentional and should stay:

  - `src/loadaddr.s` — a single `.word $0801` in the `LOADADDR`
    segment. ld65 needs *some* symbol in that segment for the 2-byte
    PRG load-address header to land at `$07FF`.
  - `src/exports.s`  — promotes the numeric equates `tcp_recv_buf`,
    `ip65_init`, `ip65_process` to linker-visible `.export`s so they
    appear in `build/labels.txt` for the Python test harness. The
    `.export` has to live in exactly one translation unit; doing it
    inside the `.inc` header would duplicate on every include.

## Smoke tests

The `tools/test_*.py` scripts cover individual crypto primitives and
the TLS state machine. For a quick sanity check after a build:

  - `tools/test_entropy.py`        — fastest (DRBG seed + fill, 7 tests)
  - `tools/test_hkdf.py`           — HKDF extract/expand
  - `tools/test_chained_hmac.py`   — HMAC chain
  - `tools/test_keyschedule_steps.py` — TLS 1.3 key schedule
  - `tools/test_tls_handshake.py`  — full handshake state machine
  - `tools/test_http.py`           — HTTP request/response build + parse
  - `tools/test_x509.py`           — X.509 parser

All 7 pass as of the ca65-conversion branch (97/97 assertions).

The `tools/uci/` scripts cover the UCI backend on U64E hardware (see
the "UCI test scripts" subsection above).

End-to-end HTTPS against a real server (`www.foo.bar` via the local
bridge rig — never a real internet domain) is still blocked on an
upstream ip65 bug unchanged by this refactor; see
`project_phase3_handoff` in memory.
